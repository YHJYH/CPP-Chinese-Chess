# CPP-Chinese-Chess
This is the final project for my UG course PHYS30672 OOP in C++;<br>
# Abstract
In this project, C++ programming language is used to create a program that allows two players to
play Chinese Chess (Xiangqi). The code is divided into three header files and two source files. Each
player has sixteen movable pieces, which are divided into seven basic pieces and each has its own
moving rules. The chess pieces are organized by inheritance and polymorphism. The aim of the
project is to allow two users to play Chinese Chess by moving one piece at a time, and decide whether
to win or lose after a specific basic piece is destroyed.
